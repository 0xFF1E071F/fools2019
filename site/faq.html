                <h1>Welcome to Glitch Islands!</h1>
                <p>Glitch Islands are split into several different <b>kingdoms</b>. Each kingdom is a small world open for exploration, with its own features to enjoy, unique quests to complete and new people to meet. Visit all of the kingdoms, rescue all inhabitants that are under Missingno.'s possession, then defeat Missingno. himself! Check the <a href='play.html'>world map</a> to see all kingdoms that are currently accessible to you. Once you've travelled to a kingdom, you'll be asked to download a Pokémon Crystal <b>save file</b> (not a ROM!). Load it in an emulator, or even on real hardware, and start playing. You can also play the game in a dedicated online emulator, as long as you supply your own Pokémon Crystal v1.0 ROM.</p>

                <h1>Change what others see!</h1>
                <p>Some pieces of in-game character dialogue contain phrases written in <b>bold face</b>. This means that the phrase in question can be changed by you or other players. You can visit the <a href='augment.html'>augmentation panel</a> to try and make some changes. This isn't free however - you will need <b>augmentation tokens</b> to perform any actions. They can be obtained either through completing <a href='profile.html'>achievements</a>, or passively by waiting: tokens will slowly accumulate on your account over time. Augmentations also vary in cost: cheap ones will just ask for a new phrase blindly, without even showing you the context in sentence - but by spending more tokens you can buy certain boosts that make your job easier.</p>

                <h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
                <p><b>The save file does not load at all?</b> Your emulator might not like the RTC information appended to the end of the file. Try changing the <a href='settings.html'>RTC settings</a>.</p>
                <p><b>You saved the game, but uploading it gives a "no save data present" message?</b> Some emulators do not actually update the save file on disk until the emulator is exited. Try closing your emulator completely once the data is saved, and then uploading.</p>
                <p><b>The save file crashes upon loading, or gives an "uncompatible ROM" message?</b> The save should only be played on English Pokémon Crystal v1.0 only. Make sure you're using a proper ROM. Here's a SHA1 hash if you want to verify that you're using a good image: <i>f4cd194bdee0d04ca4eac29e09b8e4e9d818c133</i>.</p>
                <p><b>Uploading returns a "save data has expired" message?</b> To be accepted, the save must be created with exactly the file you were asked to use. Each save file is generated by the server just for you. You can't upload save files completed by other users. You also can't upload any of your save files twice, even if they're for the same kingdom.</p>
                <p><b>You get a "save format not recognized" message?</b> Make sure you're uploading a valid save! Not a savestate, not that kitten image you downloaded from the Web - we need the SAV file.</p>
                <p><b>You selected "NEW GAME" and nothing happens?</b> Maybe try... selecting "CONTINUE"! Believe it or not, back when fools2018 was live, this was a common question.</p>
                <p><b>How fast is the passive generation of augmentation tokens?</b> The normal, base rate of passive token generation is 2 tokens per hour.</p>
